# Setting up a Dev Environment

This repo contains instructions for setting up a development environment for Data Science using Python. It started as a personal repo to host files such as a setup script and instructions for configurations in case I needed to move my dev environment to a new computer. I have added guidance for beginners, intermediate, and advanced users, for everyone else's benefit.
